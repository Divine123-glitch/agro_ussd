# Agro USSD

This is a console-based USSD-like Python application connecting buyers to farmers.
- Farmers and Buyers have separate JSON stores (`farmers.json`, `buyers.json`).
- Buyers must login (phone + password) to search farmers.
- NIN is required for registration (validated as 11 digits).
- Phone numbers must start with `+234` or `0` and follow Nigerian number length.
- Farmers can add multiple products.
- Unique IDs are generated by UUID4.
